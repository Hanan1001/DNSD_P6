# DNSD_P6
DNSD project deliverables for project 6 "Disaster pipeline"

## About the project 
Following a disaster, there are a number of different problems that may arise. Different types of disaster response organizations take care of different parts of the disasters and observe messages to understand the needs of the situation. They have the least capacity to filter out messages during a large disaster, so predictive modeling can help classify different messages more efficiently.

In this project we used RandomForest classifier as our main model.
